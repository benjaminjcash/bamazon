Please see the folder "/demo" for two gifs demonstrating the application's functionality. One shows a "succesful order" where there is enough product in stock to complete the customer's order. The database is updated to show the current stock, and the total price of the order is caclulated and displayed to the user. The other gif demonstrates an "unsuccessful order" where there is not enough stock to complete the customer's order. An error message is displayed (Sorry, we don't have enough in stock!), the database is unchanged, and the user is prompted to purchase another product.
